## Comparing .NET Dependency Injection Libraries: Bindicate, Ninject, Autofac, and Scrutor

Dependency Injection (DI) is a fundamental aspect of building scalable, maintainable, and testable .NET applications. While .NET offers its built-in IoC container, several libraries enhance or extend its capabilities, each with its unique approach. In this post we are comparing three popular libraries, and a new one: Bindicate, Ninject, Autofac, and Scrutor, to help you decide which might be best suited for your project.

---

### Ninject
[Ninject](https://github.com/ninject/Ninject) focuses on simplicity and ease of use, providing an intuitive API for developers. It employs a fluent interface for configuration, emphasizing readability and ease of understanding. Ninject is designed to make dependency injection as painless as possible.

Ideal for: Small to medium-sized projects where development speed and code readability are priorities, and performance is not the critical concern.

**Key Features:**

- Fluent interface for configuration
- Supports convention-based binding
- Lightweight and minimal performance overhead

### Autofac
[Autofac](https://github.com/autofac/Autofac) is a feature-rich IoC container known for its flexibility and broad feature set. It supports advanced scenarios such as open generics, keyed services, and modules for organizing registration logic. Autofac is designed for complex applications that require fine-grained control over their dependency injection patterns.

Ideal for: Large and complex applications that need advanced DI features, such as property and method injection, or instances that require specific lifetime management beyond the basics.

**Key Features:**

- Advanced lifetime management
- Modular registration support
- Property and method injection

### Scrutor
[Scrutor](https://github.com/khellang/Scrutor) enhances the service collection provided by Microsoft.Extensions.DependencyInjection, adding assembly scanning and decoration capabilities. It allows developers to automatically register services following certain conventions, reducing the manual configuration typically required.

Ideal for: Applications built with ASP.NET Core that need to streamline service registration without moving away from the built-in .NET Core DI container.

**Key Features:**

- Assembly scanning for automatic service registration
- Service decoration
- Extends Microsoft.Extensions.DependencyInjection without replacing it

### Bindicate
[Bindicate](https://github.com/Tim-Maes/Bindicate) simplifies the registration of services in .NET applications by using attributes directly on the classes. This approach promotes cleaner code and easier maintainability by reducing boilerplate code and closely associating the registration logic with the service class itself.

Ideal for: Projects that value simplicity and convention over configuration, where the majority of service registrations are straightforward.

**Key Features:**

- Attribute-based service registration
- Supports scopes, transients, singletons and keyed services
- Can register options
- Simplifies .NET configuration

### Comparison Summary

**Ease of Use**: Ninject and Bindicate both prioritize ease of use, with Bindicate focusing on minimal configuration via attributes and Ninject on a readable, fluent API.

**Advanced Features**: Autofac leads when it comes to supporting advanced DI scenarios, making it suitable for complex applications.
Convention Over Configuration: Scrutor and Bindicate both embrace this principle, but Scrutor focuses on assembly scanning while Bindicate uses attributes for service registration.

**Performance**: While all libraries perform adequately for most applications, Ninject and Bindicate might have the edge in applications where performance is not the primary concern, and simplicity is valued.

### Conclusion
Choosing the right DI library for your .NET project depends on your specific needs. If simplicity and minimal configuration are key, Bindicate offers a unique approach with its attribute-based registration. For projects requiring a more conventional configuration approach with a fluent interface, Ninject is a great choice. Autofac stands out for complex applications that need advanced features and fine-grained control over DI. Lastly, Scrutor is ideal for those who wish to enhance the built-in capabilities of .NET's DI container without completely replacing it.

Understanding the strengths and limitations of each option can help you make an informed decision, ensuring your project's success.
